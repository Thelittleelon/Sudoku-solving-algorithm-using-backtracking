# Sudoku-solving-algorithm-using-backtracking
This is a project to create an algorithm to solve a given Sudoku puzzle. Moreover, I also created a software with GUI, using MFC in Microsoft Visual Studio, to play the game interactively. In this process, I wrote another algorithm to build a sudoku puzzle, and I make sure that the puzzles created only have one unique solution.
